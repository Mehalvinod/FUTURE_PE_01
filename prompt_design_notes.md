These prompts were designed using structured role assignment, contextual grounding, constraint-based instructions, and defined output formats to ensure consistency and real-world usability.


## Prompt Design Approach

This project uses a structured prompt engineering approach to ensure consistency and usability in real-world scenarios.

Key techniques applied:

- Role-based prompting to guide AI expertise
- Clear business context to improve relevance
- Constraint-driven instructions to control output quality
- Defined output formats for publish-ready content
- Tone adaptation to support different audience needs

The goal was to design reusable prompts that mirror workflows used by web agencies when generating website copy for local businesses.
